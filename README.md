## Overview

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) combines Machine Learning (ML) with DevOps practices to automate the lifecycle of ML models. This directory contains various scripts, configurations, and frameworks to support the following activities:

- Data pipeline management
- Model training and validation
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
- Model deployment (e.g., to Kubernetes, cloud services)
- Model monitoring and retraining
